This is a bot to automatically import Halo Infinite maps "forged" in my Forge For Blender addon along with the .mvar files from the leaked build of forge (rotation is currently not perfect).


Requirements before hiting start

- Linear Navigation Mode enabled. Accessibiliyt tab in settings
- All the categories in the Object Browser need to be closed
- All the Object Properties tabs need to be open



All development is done in the dev branch. I will merge to main for releases
